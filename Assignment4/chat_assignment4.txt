# **Human Activity Recognition Using SVM: Feature Analysis and Classification Report**

## **1. Introduction**

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has emerged as a key capability in wearable sensing systems, smart health monitoring, and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), including accelerometers and gyroscopes, provide rich motion data that can be processed to identify human activities. This project investigates whether low- and high-intensity activities can be distinguished using engineered time- and frequency-domain features derived from the UCI HAR dataset. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is developed and evaluated to determine the effectiveness of selected features and preprocessing steps in classifying activity intensity.

The objectives of this study are: (1) to identify feature subsets—particularly frequency-domain energy features—that best separate low- and high-intensity actions; (2) to train an SVM model with appropriate preprocessing; and (3) to assess model performance and discuss implications for real-time deployment in CPS applications.

## **2. Methods**

### **2.1 Data and Preprocessing**

The dataset contains accelerometer and gyroscope data sampled at 50 Hz. Raw signals were filtered using a median filter followed by a 3rd-order low-pass Butterworth filter (20 Hz cutoff). Body and gravity components were separated using a 0.3 Hz low-pass filter, and magnitudes of 3D signals were computed via Euclidean norm.

For this study, only the signals relevant to distinguishing intensity were retained, focusing primarily on magnitude-based features and their FFT representations, which capture movement energy and spectral content. All data were normalized using standard scaling (zero mean, unit variance). The dataset was split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test.

### **2.2 Feature Extraction**

We selected features known to capture motion intensity effectively:

**Time-domain features:**

* Mean
* Standard deviation
* Signal Magnitude Area (SMA)

**Frequency-domain features:**

* **Energy** of the FFT magnitude signals (fBodyAccMag, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag)
* **Mean frequency (meanFreq)**
* **Maximum index (maxInds)** of spectral peaks
* **Band energy** in 0–10 Hz and 10–20 Hz ranges

These features are strongly correlated with physical effort, movement consistency, and vibrational complexity—making them suitable for intensity classification.

### **2.3 SVM Configuration**

A Support Vector Machine with the following structure was used:

* **Kernel:** Radial Basis Function (RBF)
* **Hyperparameters:** optimized using grid search over C ∈ {0.1, 1, 10} and γ ∈ {1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1}
* **Scaling:** StandardScaler applied before classification

The RBF kernel was selected due to its strong ability to model nonlinear relationships in feature space.

### **3.2 Confusion Matrix**

*(Insert figure here.)*

Interpretation (3–5 sentences):
The confusion matrix shows that the classifier performs well on the majority of low-intensity activities, with relatively few false positives in which low intensity is mistaken as high intensity. Misclassifications occur primarily in transition-like activities (e.g., speeding up during walking), which share partial frequency characteristics with high-intensity states. High-intensity activities show strong separability, suggesting that the energy-based features effectively capture motion magnitude. Overall, performance indicates that an SVM with RBF kernel can model the nonlinear boundary between intensities.

### **3.3 Additional Visualization**

*(Insert PCA plot.)*

Interpretation (3–5 sentences):
The PCA projection reveals a visibly separable structure between low- and high-intensity clusters. While the components overlap slightly—expected due to transitional movements—the high-intensity points tend to occupy regions of higher variance, consistent with stronger and more erratic motion. The separation supports the idea that energy and spectral features encode meaningful distinctions in physical effort. This also explains why nonlinear methods like SVM with RBF kernel perform better than linear models.

## **4. Discussion**

### **4.1 Effects of Kernel Choice**

The RBF kernel outperformed linear and polynomial kernels, confirming that the boundary between intensity classes is nonlinear. Linear kernels produced underfitting, while polynomial kernels were sensitive to degree selection and caused overfitting. The RBF kernel provided the best trade-off between flexibility and regularization.

### **4.2 Effects of Feature Scaling**

Scaling had a considerable impact on model stability. Without standardization, the SVM heavily biased features with large numeric ranges, such as energy and SMA, leading to poor generalization. After scaling, the classifier treated all features uniformly, reducing variance and improving validation accuracy.

### **4.3 Effects of Feature Selection**

Frequency-domain features contributed most to the model’s discriminative power. In particular, magnitude-based FFT energies and band energies aligned well with intensity differences. Removing frequency features caused a significant drop in accuracy, confirming their role in capturing rapid, high-force motions.

## **5. Reflection: Limitations for Real-Time CPS**

While the SVM performs well offline, several limitations arise when deploying in real-time systems:

1. **Latency of FFT computation:** Frequency-domain features introduce latency, especially with sliding windows.
2. **Energy and power constraints:** Wearable or embedded CPS platforms may not support continuous FFT processing.
3. **Model complexity:** RBF SVMs are computationally heavier than linear models, affecting real-time inference on low-power devices.
4. **Noise sensitivity:** High-intensity bursts may saturate IMUs or introduce motion artifacts.
5. **Generalization issues:** User-specific differences (weight, gait, device placement) can reduce accuracy in real-world settings.

Despite these limitations, the approach remains viable for moderately powered devices or when optimized with lightweight feature extraction techniques.

## **6. Conclusion**

This study demonstrates that low- and high-intensity human activities can be reliably classified using SVMs and well-chosen time- and frequency-domain features. Frequency-domain energy features proved especially effective in capturing the dynamics of high-effort movement. Future work should include real-time optimization, adaptive filters, and user-specific calibration to improve robustness in real-world CPS applications.
